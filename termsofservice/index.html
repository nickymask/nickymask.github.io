            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Nickymask.com. By using our website and services, you agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully.</p>

            <h3>1. Website Purpose</h3>
            <p>Our website is dedicated to driving traffic to digital products and exclusive content. All offerings are digital, and no physical products are sold.</p>

            <h3>2. User Rules and Expectations</h3>
            <p>We strive to create a positive and respectful community. By using our services, you agree to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be courteous and respectful to others.</li>
                <li>Avoid spamming or posting offensive content.</li>
                <li>Do not use or share our content on other platforms without explicit permission.</li>
                <li>Respect anonymity: Do not share real personal information about others.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Violations may result in a lifetime ban if they negatively impact others. We aim to inspire, educate, and entertain. Once you pay for our services, you can connect and collaborate with other members.</p>

            <h3>3. Liability Limitations</h3>
            <p>You may not download or distribute content for personal or commercial gain unless specified. Exceptions apply to customizable digital products, such as planners or website-building tools, which are designed for user customization and resale.</p>

            <h3>4. Membership and Subscription Details</h3>
            <p>Memberships are handled through platforms like Ko-fi, where we build a community of gamers and collaborators. Funds generated are used to pay holders of digital ownership, such as NFTs. All sensitive information, including personal and payment details, is managed by third-party platforms like Ko-fi, PayPal, Stripe, and OnlyFans.</p>

            <h3>5. Disputes and Complaints</h3>

            <h3>6. Age Restrictions</h3>
            <p>We offer both SFW and NSFW content. Safe-for-work (SFW) content is related to consulting, gaming, and digital products, while NSFW content (on OnlyFans) is clearly separated on our site. Age verification for NSFW content is managed by OnlyFans, and payment eligibility is handled by Ko-fi, PayPal, and Stripe.</p>

            <h3>7. Cancellation, Refunds, and Payments</h3>
            <p>You can cancel your membership on platforms like OnlyFans and Ko-fi at any time. These platforms handle cancellations and refunds.

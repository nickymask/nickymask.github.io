            <h1>Delivery Information</h1>
            
            <h3>1. Products or Digital Services Delivered</h3>
            <p>We provide digital products such as planners and consulting services. Consulting is conducted through voice calls, emails, or voice messages via private Telegram channels. Other digital products, including planners and videos, are streamed through platforms like Ko-fi, OnlyFans, or Telegram private groups. Written text or messages are also delivered via these channels for SFW instructions or announcements.</p>

            <h3>2. Time Frame for Delivery</h3>
            <p><strong>Digital products:</strong> Delivery is immediate once instructions are provided.</p>
            <p><strong>Consulting:</strong> Response time is generally less than 1 hour, depending on time zones. If I'm not asleep, I usually respond within that window, but no more than 24 hours. If you believe your email or purchase notification was missed, feel free to contact me via Twitter <a href="https://x.com/nickymask" class="text-white">@nickymask</a>, visit my website at <a href="https://nickymask.com" class="text-white">nickymask.com</a>, or email <a href="mailto:help@nickymask.com" class="text-white">help@nickymask.com</a>.</p>

            <h3>3. Restrictions</h3>
            <p>Most digital assets are sent to your email for download via Ko-fi, OnlyFans, or other platforms. In some cases, delivery may be expedited using services like WeTransfer or similar cloud storage solutions.</p>

            <h3>4. Shipping Methods</h3>
            <p>Currently, no physical products are shipped. If physical products are introduced in the future, they will be handled by the respective platform managing production and shipping. For now, all deliveries are digital.</p>

            <h3>5. Return and Exchange Policies</h3>
            <p>If you are unsatisfied with any digital product or membership and wish to cancel, you can do so through the platform (Ko-fi, OnlyFans), or contact me directly at <a href="mailto:help@nickymask.com" class="text-white">help@nickymask.com</a>. I will happily refund you, regardless of the time frame. However, since digital products are consumed instantly, it's difficult to return them. Still, I will do everything possible to ensure your satisfaction.</p>

            <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
            <p>This Privacy Notice explains how we handle your personal information when you engage with our website and services.</p>

            <h3>1. Type of Information Collected</h3>
            <p>We do not directly collect any personal information such as emails or payment details. All transactions, including payment processing, are handled securely by external platforms like PayPal, Stripe, Ko-fi, and OnlyFans. If you access NSFW content, you will be directed to OnlyFans or another platform where those transactions take place.</p>

            <h3>2. How Information is Collected</h3>
            <p>We do not collect any information from users directly through our website. No cookies are used. In case of a purchase, we may receive the email address you used on external platforms to resolve any issues or send you digital materials related to your purchase.</p>

            <h3>3. Why We Collect Information</h3>
            <p>We only receive your email address from external platforms (e.g., PayPal, Ko-fi, etc.) to facilitate customer support or to send digital content that you have purchased. We do not collect or store any other information.</p>

            <h3>4. How We Store and Protect User Data</h3>
            <p>Since we do not directly collect or store your data, any data shared during a transaction is managed by third-party platforms like Ko-fi, PayPal, and OnlyFans. Please refer to their privacy policies for information on how they protect your data.</p>

            <h3>5. Sharing of Data</h3>
            <p>We do not share your personal data with third parties. However, if you agree or collaborate with us (or pay a fee), we may share your information for traffic-driving services, such as promoting your site or social media profile on our platforms (e.g., X, Instagram).</p>

            <h3>6. Managing and Deleting Your Data</h3>
            <p>If you wish to delete any data that we have received, such as your email for digital product delivery, you can simply email us at <a href="mailto:help@nickymask.com" class="text-white">help@nickymask.com</a>. We will delete your information as requested.</p>

            <h3>7. Business Location</h3>
